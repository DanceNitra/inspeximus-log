"""Check this log without trusting whoever published it. Standard library only.

    python verify.py            # in the directory holding head.json

It rebuilds the RFC 6962 Merkle root from the published leaf hashes and compares it with the root in
head.json, then re-derives sth_hash from the head's own fields. A published root that does not follow
from the published leaves is what this catches, and it is exactly what an operator rewriting history
would have to change.

THE HASHING IS RFC 6962 AND THE DETAILS MATTER. Leaves are SHA-256(0x00 || data) and nodes are
SHA-256(0x01 || left || right), and the tree splits at the largest power of two STRICTLY below n, not
into pairs. The first draft of this file used pairwise levels and a plain SHA-256 leaf, which agrees
with the real tree only when the entry count is a power of two: it would have reported FAILED on an
honest log of three entries, under a heading that invites you to distrust us.

What it does NOT check: the signature on the head, which needs an Ed25519 implementation, and whether
any entry is TRUE. A log proves what was recorded, never that it is right.
